    <h1 class="title">Chicken & Broccoli Bowl</h1>
    <img src="../img/cbb.jpg">
    <div class="intro">I could give you some crazy convoluted story about how my grandmother taught me this recipe after getting
        cracked up on benzos and getting into a car accident. But the reality is, I just wanted to see if I could pan sear chicken breast and make
        it not suck. It ended up working and I had it with rice and broccoli. I have been eating it ever since.

    <div class="list">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="ing">1 Chicken Breast (Per Bowl)</li>
            <li class="ing">Rice (Whichever kind you like, I prefer short grain.)</li>
            <li class="ing">Cilantro (Dried works but fresh is always better.)</li>
            <li class="ing">2 Limes (Lime juice works fine too.)</li>
            <li class="ing">1 Head of Broccoli (Frozen broccoli works fine too.)</li>
            <li class="ing">3 Tbs of Olive oil</li>
            <li class="ing">1 Tbs of Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li class="list-item">Start cooking the rice</li>
            <p class="listdesc">I would tell you how to do it, but I have a rice cooker. <strong>DO NOT </strong>forget to wash your rice.
            Season the rice generously with salt and optionally add a Tbsp of olive oil into the rice before cooking.
            </p>
            <li class="list-item">Cook the broccoli</li>
            <p class="listdesc">If you're like me and have a rice cooker that has a steam basket. You can just chip up the broccoli into florettes and
                steam them in the rice cooker. Otherwise your going to want to boil them until they are for tender. I tend to like mine very soft and the steam basket
                is perfect for that.
            </p>
            <li class="list-item">Prepare the chicken breast for cooking.</li>
            <p class="listdesc">Make sure you have a heavy bottomed pan. (Try not to use nonstick pans if you can help it) Pound out the chicken breast with
                the flat head of a meat mallet or some sort of canned good if you don't have a mallet. It helps if you cover the chicken in saran wrap while flattening it.
                We do this to help the chicken cook evenly. Although if you like some overcooked bits and some perfectly cooked bits, feel free to skip the flattening.
                Season your chicken however you like. I tend to season heavily with garlic powder and black pepper. Then I use some Tony Chachere's to finish it off.
            </p>
            <li class="list-item">Cook the chicken</li>
            <p class="listdesc">Preheat your pan on a medium-high heat with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Once the oil is shimmering place you chicken
                into the pan and sear that side for 2 mins. Flip and sear the other side for another 2 mins. Then lower your heat to medium low,
                add your butter to the pan and cover for 3 mins. Remove the lid, and baste the chicken with the butter in the pan 30 seconds per side. Repeating 
                until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160-165 Degrees Farenheit. Remove from pan and set aside to rest.
            </p>
            <li class="list-item">Finish up the rice</li>
            <p class="listdesc">Once the rice is done cooking. Add the juice of 2 limes to it, your chopped cilantro, and the broccoli. Then give it a good
                mix </p>
            <li class="list-item">(Optional) Pan sauce</li>
            <p class="listdesc">You can make a quick pan sauce from the butter, olive oil, and chicken fond. Scrape up all the tasty chicken bits stuck to the pan.
                Then add a small amount of flour to the pand and mix it up on a medium heat until it thickens. Then pour it straight into the rice for a massive flavor boost. 
            </p>
            <li class="list-item">Plate up!</li>
            <p class="listdesc">I usually serve this in a bowl but, a plate works just fine. Slice up the chicken into eatable slices, serve atop the rice. You can optionally 
                add something else as well. I usually serve it with a nice buttery toasted slice of sourdough bread.
